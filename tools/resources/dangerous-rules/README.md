# Dangerous rules

This tool is designed to find dangerous rules in filter lists. It uses the open AI api. So it shouldn't be run too often.

To use it, you need to get an API key and put to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, or to the `.env` file. You can view `.env.example` in the root of the repository.
